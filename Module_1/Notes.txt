- an element consists of a opening tag, content and then closing tag
Nesting - placing elements withing elements
Block level elemtent - for a visible block on a page. encompasses the whole block
Inline element - contained within block level elements and surround small parts of the content
Void elemtents - embed or insert something in the document. May not need proper openining and closing tags
Attributes - contain extra information about the element that wont show in the content
 <a> makes the eclosed content a hyperlink
 - No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space character, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code.
