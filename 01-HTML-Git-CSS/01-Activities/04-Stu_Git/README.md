# 📖 Create a New GitHub Repository

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a new GitHub repository and add an HTML file to it.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a new repository named `first-day-repo` using the GitHub user interface.

* It's done when I have cloned the `first-day-repo` to my local machine.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to navigate into the `first-day-repo` directory.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to create an `index.html` file.

* It's done when I add and commit my changes using Git commands.

* It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository.

## 🏆 Bonus

* What are the `git fetch` and `git merge` commands? 
git Fetch - is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository.
