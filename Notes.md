HTML
- the element insife of tags is case insensitive but recommended practice is to write in lowercase
- an element consists of a opening tag, content and then closing tag
Nesting - placing elements withing elements
Block level elemtent - for a visible block on a page. encompasses the whole block
Inline element - contained within block level elements and surround small parts of the content
Void elemtents - embed or insert something in the document. May not need proper openining and closing tags
Attributes - contain extra information about the element that wont show in the content
 <a> makes the eclosed content a hyperlink
 - No matter how much whitespace you use inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space character, but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code.

CSS Positioning
1. static: Default one.
2. relative : Same as static. But lets you add top, right, bottom, left. Makes it move relative to it's normal position
3. absolute: Removes from the flow and positions absolute wrt to the parent. Parent has to be relative or absolute for top, right, bottom, left to work. Else it considers the main html element as the  parent .
4. fixed : Fixed to a place. Doesn't give two shits about the parent. Always considers html element as the parent. Stays there when scrolled.
5. sticky : Relative ( when normal) + fixed ( when scrolled). The values for top, right, bottom, left become active when scrolled
git init - initialize a repository on your local maching - must be in the folder you want the repo in
Positioning is based on margins
Display property says whether an element is an inlin eor a block element
viewport is the entire screen/webpage
